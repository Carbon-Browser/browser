// Keywords allow selecting filters that could potentially match a URL faster
// than an exhaustive search.
// This is how it works:
// 1. Each URL is split into keywords using
// GetNextKeyword().
// "https://content.adblockplus.com/advertisment" becomes:
// "content", "adblockplus", "advertisment"
// - "https" and "com" are skipped because they're common
//
// 2. The keyword index in the flatbuffer is queried only for filters that match
// these keywords. A keyword may index multiple filters, a filter is only
// indexed by one (or none) keywords.
//
// 3. If we fail to extract keywords from a filter, we index it under an empty
// keyword. All filters without a keyword are checked for all URLs, as they
// could match anything.
