This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] Test mousepointer capture in same-origin frame: Pointer down at outer frame body and set pointer capture in inner frame should not capture.
  assert_array_equals: Received events: outerFrame received pointerdown,innerFrameElement received gotpointercapture,innerFrameElement received pointermove,innerFrameElement received pointerup,innerFrameElement received lostpointercapture lengths differ, expected array ["outerFrame received pointerdown", "outerFrame received pointermove", "outerFrame received pointerup"] length 3, got ["outerFrame received pointerdown", "innerFrameElement received gotpointercapture", "innerFrameElement received pointermove", "innerFrameElement received pointerup", "innerFrameElement received lostpointercapture"] length 5
Harness: the test ran to completion.
