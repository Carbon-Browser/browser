Description:
This contains a part of LZMA SDK 21.07.

Local Modifications:
The original code can be found at https://7-zip.org/a/lzma2107.7z.  Only parts
of this archive are copied here.  More specifically:

1/ C code required to open 7z archive files and uncompress LZMA
2/ 7za.exe and 7zr.exe executables (amd64 version)
3/ source code for SfxSetup, a utility for creating self extracting archives
4/ C code required for xz decompression (split into its own static library)

7za.exe and 7zr.exe are both standalone command-line utilities to archive and
extract files. 7zr is "lightweight" and only handles 7zip extensions. 7za can
handle a few more. 7za.exe comes from https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2107-extra.7z.

The patch in chromium.patch was applied to 7zCrc.c, CpuArch.c, LZFind.c and
Sha256.c to disable some ARM code that was failing to build in Android and
Fuschia as well as some of the AVX2 and SSE4 code for Windows. In Fuschia,
`#include <asm/hwcap.h>` is not available. In Android builds, `armv8-a+crc` is
not a known target architecture, even when the -march cflag is passed,
specifying the CPU type to use. In Windows, Chromium still supports SSE3,
so it is not be ready to transition to utilizing AVX2 and SSE4, yet.

The patch in Util/SfxSetup/chromium.patch was applied so that:

1/ Fix for includes file names, since the original code causes an include
   file violation during git cl presubmit.
2/ Extended search range for 7z archive signature to accomodate
   increased sfx binary size in debug builds.
