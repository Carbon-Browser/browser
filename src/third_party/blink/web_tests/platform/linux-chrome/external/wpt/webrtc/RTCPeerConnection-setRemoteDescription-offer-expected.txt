Harness Error. harness_status.status = 1 , harness_status.message = Unhandled rejection: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to parse SessionDescription. Invalid SDP Expect line: v=
[FAIL] setRemoteDescription(offer) with invalid SDP should reject with RTCError
  assert_equals: Expect error detail field to set to sdp-syntax-error expected (string) "sdp-syntax-error" but got (undefined) undefined
[FAIL] setRemoteDescription(offer) from have-local-offer fires signalingstatechange twice
  assert_equals: expected null but got object "[object RTCSessionDescription]"
[FAIL] setRemoteDescription(offer) in have-local-offer should update internal state with a queued task, in the right order
  assert_equals: pendingRemoteDescription should be updated before the signalingstatechange event expected null but got object "[object RTCSessionDescription]"
[FAIL] Naive rollback approach is not glare-proof (control)
  assert_unreached: Should have rejected: undefined Reached unreachable code
[TIMEOUT] setRemoteDescription(invalidOffer) from have-local-offer does not undo rollback
  Test timed out
[NOTRUN] repeated sRD(offer) works
[NOTRUN] sRD(reoffer) with candidates and without trickle works
