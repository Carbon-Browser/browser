# Data collection

eyeo Chromium SDK collects some amount of user data, in order to increase our understanding of the usage across platforms, versions, etc, and help drive the development.

One of eyeo's main principles is to respect users' privacy. This is why none of the requests sent to data collection services contain any personally identifiable information.

The services in place are:

* [User counting](user-counting.md)

More information about the specific data gathered by a service can be found in the corresponding documentation.
