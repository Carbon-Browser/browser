// This is how it works:
//
// 1. A filter pattern is split into keywords via GetNextKeyword()
// like so:
// ||content.adblockplus.com/ad
// becomes:
// "content", "adblockplus"
// - "com" is skipped because it's a very common component
// - "ad" is skipped, explanation in .cc
//
// 2. Once we have keywords that describe the filter, the longest or most unique
// keyword gets chosen to index the filter within the flatbuffer. In this case,
// "adblockplus".
