    auto-generated. In either case, it's not going to count as a search engine.
    Also, it only checks to see if the *referrer* is from a domain associated
    with search engine. If someone posts a link somewhere on a web site that
    happens to have a search engine known to Google and that links includes the
    fragment tokens, then if a user clicks that link, it'll look like it came
