This directory contains code and data used by eyeo for:
- internal validation testing of the ad-filtering logic
- various benchmarks and performance tests

There are more functional tests (unit tests, browser tests, ...) scattered elsewhere in the source directories.

These particular tests are kept separate to avoid bundling significant amount of data with deliverable code.
