This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] cross-document traversals in opposite directions, second traversal invalid at queuing time but valid at the time it is run: the result is going nowhere
  assert_unreached: second load event Reached unreachable code
[FAIL PASS] cross-document traversals in the same (back) direction: the result is going -2 with only one load event
  assert_equals: first load event must be going back expected "?1" but got "?2"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
